# Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through understanding and implementing three essential data structures: Stack, Linked List, and Tree.

For any suggestions or contributions, create a pull request to go over it.

### How to do it.

I've made this csharp tutorial to be self-guided, however, consider following the instructions to make it more interactive. This will help you to learn faster.

1. Go through the .md file, make sure you understand what the Data Structure means and for what is for.
2. Go through the example, once again, make sure you understand the example and read the comments.
3. Go through the problem, if needed go back to the material, you might find some hints! :)
4. Once you have finish with the problem. __NOT BEFORE__. Go to the solution file. The solution file is the BEST way to learn, compare your code with the solutuion, I leave comments to understand why is the way it is.
