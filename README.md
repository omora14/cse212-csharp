# Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through understanding and implementing three essential data structures: Stack, Linked List, and Tree.

For any suggestions or contributions, create a pull request to go over it.

## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and play a crucial role in computer science and software engineering.

### Importance of Data Structures

1. **Efficiency:** Proper use of data structures can lead to more efficient algorithms. For example, using a hash table can make searching operations much faster compared to using a list.
2. **Manageability:** They help in managing and organizing data, making it easier to handle large amounts of data effectively.
3. **Reusability:** Many data structures are reusable, meaning they can be used in various applications, saving time and effort in coding.

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It characterizes functions according to their growth rates: how quickly they grow relative to the input size.

- **O(1):** Constant time - The algorithm's performance is not affected by the size of the input data.
- **O(n):** Linear time - The algorithm's performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data.
- **O(n^2):** Quadratic time - The algorithm's performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data.
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic time - The algorithm's performance will grow logarithmically as the input size increases.

Understanding Big O notation helps in analyzing the efficiency and scalability of algorithms, which is essential in software development.

### How to Use This Tutorial

I've made this C# tutorial to be self-guided, however, consider following the instructions to make it more interactive. This will help you learn faster.

1. Go through the .md file, make sure you understand what the Data Structure means and what it is used for.
2. Go through the example, once again, make sure you understand the example and read the comments.
3. Go through the problem, if needed go back to the material, you might find some hints! :)
4. Once you have finished with the problem. **NOT BEFORE.** Go to the solution file. The solution file is the BEST way to learn, compare your code with the solution, and I leave comments to help you understand why it is the way it is.
